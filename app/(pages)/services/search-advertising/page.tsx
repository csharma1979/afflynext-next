              <h3>How does search advertising work?</h3>
              <p>
                Search advertising displays your ads to users who are actively
                searching for keywords related to your business. You only pay
                when someone clicks on your ad, making it a cost-effective way
                to reach potential customers.

            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>What platforms do you advertise on?</h3>
              <p>
                We manage campaigns across major search engines including Google
                Ads, Bing Ads, and other relevant platforms based on your target
                audience and goals.

              <h3>How long does it take to see results?</h3>
              <p>
                While initial results can be seen quickly, we typically
                recommend a 3-month period to fully optimize campaigns and
                achieve optimal performance.

                rates, cost per click, and return on ad spend to measure
