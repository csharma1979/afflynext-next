              <h3>What is native advertising?</h3>
              <p>
                Native advertising is a form of paid media where the ad
                experience follows the natural form and function of the platform
                where it appears, creating a more seamless user experience.

            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>Which platforms do you work with?</h3>
              <p>
                We create native advertising campaigns across major platforms
                including social media, content discovery networks, and premium
                publisher sites.

              <h3>How do you measure success?</h3>
              <p>
                We track key metrics including engagement rates, time spent,
                conversion rates, and ROI to measure campaign effectiveness and
                optimize performance.

              <h3>How long until we see results?</h3>
              <p>
                While initial results can be seen quickly, we typically
                recommend a 2-3 month period to fully optimize campaigns and
                achieve optimal performance.
